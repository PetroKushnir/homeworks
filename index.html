                    <p>I hear the train a comin'
                    It's rolling round the bend
                    And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
                    I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
                    But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
                    When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
                    Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
                    But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
                    When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry.. </p>

                    <p>I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
                    They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
                    Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
                    But those people keep a movin'
                    And that's what tortures me...</p>

                    <p>Well if they freed me from this prison,
                    If that railroad train was mine
                    I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
                    Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
                    And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....</p>
